# ServerLogger

This is a bot that doesn't have any command just some events to make server logs for you server and also langauge filter too and also make sure this is a private bot for which can be only used by your server since since this bot is meant to be stable only in one sever

**I do not recommend this bot as a public bot at all !!**
